# Structural Design Patterns in Python

Structural design patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. These patterns help make the system easier to manage and scale.

## 1. Adapter Pattern

### **Description:**
The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge between two objects, making one class's interface compatible with another.

### **Use Case:**
- When you have an existing class with a specific interface and need to integrate it with another class that uses a different interface.
- Especially useful when dealing with third-party libraries or legacy systems that cannot be modified directly.

### **When to Use:**
- When you need to integrate new systems with old systems without changing the old system’s code.
- If external libraries or APIs have incompatible interfaces with your code.

## 2. Bridge Pattern

### **Description:**
The Bridge Pattern separates abstraction from implementation, allowing them to evolve independently. It involves creating two separate class hierarchies—one for the abstraction and one for the implementation.

### **Use Case:**
- When you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.
- When the number of possible combinations between abstraction and implementation might grow large, making the code difficult to maintain.

### **When to Use:**
- When both the abstraction and implementation should be able to vary independently.
- If you need to separate different concerns and avoid tightly coupled classes that are hard to modify.

## 3. Composite Pattern

### **Description:**
The Composite Pattern is used to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

### **Use Case:**
- When you need to treat individual objects and composite objects (groups of objects) the same way.
- Typically used in tree structures such as file systems or organization hierarchies.

### **When to Use:**
- When you need to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects and want to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- If you want to manage complex structures where objects can be nested within other objects.

## 4. Decorator Pattern

### **Description:**
The Decorator Pattern allows you to dynamically add behavior to an object at runtime. It provides an alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### **Use Case:**
- When you need to add responsibilities to individual objects without affecting other objects of the same class.
- Helps in modifying the behavior of an object without changing its class.

### **When to Use:**
- When you need to add new functionality to objects without altering their structure or class.
- When the behavior needs to be dynamically added or removed at runtime.

## 5. Facade Pattern

### **Description:**
The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, hiding its complexities. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

### **Use Case:**
- When you need to simplify complex interactions between multiple subsystems.
- Provides a high-level interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.

### **When to Use:**
- When working with complex subsystems, and you want to simplify the interaction for the user.
- If you need to provide a simpler interface to a complex system that consists of multiple interacting parts.

## 6. Flyweight Pattern

### **Description:**
The Flyweight Pattern reduces memory usage by sharing common data between similar objects. It allows you to share objects instead of creating new ones to reduce overhead.

### **Use Case:**
- When you need to create a large number of objects that are similar and share common data.
- It is useful in systems that need to conserve memory, like rendering graphical elements that have similar properties.

### **When to Use:**
- When your system involves creating large numbers of similar objects, especially if they share common state.
- If conserving memory and improving performance are priorities.

## 7. Proxy Pattern

### **Description:**
The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder object to control access to another object. It acts as an intermediary to control access to a real object, often for reasons such as lazy initialization, access control, or logging.

### **Use Case:**
- When you want to control access to a resource, such as a large object or an expensive resource.
- Useful for implementing lazy initialization, caching, or access control.

### **When to Use:**
- When an object is expensive to create, and you want to defer the creation until necessary (lazy loading).
- If you want to control access to an object, for example, to restrict direct access or perform additional actions before or after the real object is accessed.

## Conclusion

Understanding when and how to use these structural design patterns can greatly improve the flexibility, scalability, and maintainability of your Python applications. Depending on the specific problem you're solving, you can choose the pattern that best suits your needs.

- Use **Adapter** when you need to integrate incompatible interfaces.
- Use **Bridge** when you want to separate abstraction and implementation.
- Use **Composite** for part-whole hierarchies and tree structures.
- Use **Decorator** when you need to add behavior dynamically.
- Use **Facade** to simplify complex subsystems.
- Use **Flyweight** to conserve memory with shared objects.
- Use **Proxy** to control access to expensive or critical resources.
