# Behavioral Design Patterns: Summary and Use Cases

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They focus on how objects interact, communicate, and change state. Below is a summary of key behavioral design patterns with their use cases.

## 1. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
### Summary:
The **Chain of Responsibility** pattern allows passing a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler either processes the request or passes it along to the next handler.

### Use Case:
- **When to use**: Use this pattern when you have a set of handlers for a request and you don't know which one will handle it. It’s ideal when there are multiple potential objects that can handle a request and you want to decouple the sender and receivers.
  
### Example:
- Logging system where different loggers handle various log levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).

## 2. Command Pattern
### Summary:
The **Command** pattern turns a request into a stand-alone object. The object contains all the details about the request, which can be executed at a later time.

### Use Case:
- **When to use**: Use this pattern when you need to parameterize objects with operations, delay execution, or queue requests for execution. It’s useful for undo/redo functionality or when you need to decouple the sender and receiver of a request.

### Example:
- A remote control that can execute commands like turning on or off different devices (e.g., TV, light).

---

## 3. Interpreter Pattern
### Summary:
The **Interpreter** pattern defines a grammar for interpreting a language and implements an interpreter for evaluating sentences in that language.

### Use Case:
- **When to use**: Use this pattern when you have a language or expression that needs to be interpreted or evaluated. It’s useful for scenarios like parsing simple languages or command interpreters.

### Example:
- Mathematical expression evaluation or SQL query parsing.

---

## 4. Iterator Pattern
### Summary:
The **Iterator** pattern provides a way to sequentially access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying structure.

### Use Case:
- **When to use**: Use this pattern when you want to provide a standard interface for traversing a collection (e.g., list, set, or array) without exposing the details of how the collection is stored or organized.

### Example:
- Iterating over elements in a collection like a list of names or employee records.

---

## 5. Mediator Pattern
### Summary:
The **Mediator** pattern defines an object that controls the communication between a set of objects, promoting loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly.

### Use Case:
- **When to use**: Use this pattern when you have a group of objects that need to communicate with each other, but you want to centralize the communication logic in one object to prevent direct dependencies between the objects.

### Example:
- A chat application where messages are sent through a central mediator to avoid direct communication between users.

---

## 6. Memento Pattern
### Summary:
The **Memento** pattern allows capturing and externalizing an object's internal state without violating encapsulation so that the object can be restored to this state later.

### Use Case:
- **When to use**: Use this pattern when you need to capture the state of an object at a given time and later restore it, like implementing undo/redo functionality or saving the state of a game.

### Example:
- A text editor that allows you to undo changes to a document or a game that saves the player's progress.

---

## 7. Observer Pattern
### Summary:
The **Observer** pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, where one object (subject) notifies other objects (observers) of state changes, typically through a callback mechanism.

### Use Case:
- **When to use**: Use this pattern when one object’s state changes need to be automatically reflected in other objects without tight coupling between them. It’s useful in event-driven systems where you have many listeners for an event.

### Example:
- A news feed system where multiple subscribers (users) are notified when a new article is posted.

---

## 8. State Pattern
### Summary:
The **State** pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

### Use Case:
- **When to use**: Use this pattern when an object needs to change its behavior based on its internal state, or when you have complex condition-based behavior and want to simplify the management of state transitions.

### Example:
- A game character that behaves differently when it is in "Idle", "Running", or "Attacking" state.

---

## Conclusion

### When to Use Which Pattern:
- **Chain of Responsibility**: When there are multiple objects that could handle a request and you want to decouple the sender from the handlers.
- **Command**: When you want to encapsulate a request and decouple the sender and receiver.
- **Interpreter**: When you need to interpret sentences or expressions in a defined language.
- **Iterator**: When you need to iterate over a collection without exposing its underlying structure.
- **Mediator**: When you need to centralize the communication logic between multiple objects.
- **Memento**: When you need to capture and restore an object’s state, typically for undo/redo scenarios.
- **Observer**: When you have one-to-many dependencies where a change in one object should automatically notify its dependents.
- **State**: When an object’s behavior changes based on its internal state and you want to manage state transitions cleanly.
